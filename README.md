# roadhog-cheat
A yolov5 trained aimbot for roadhog in overwatch
# How this aimbot works ?
honestly, I don't know much about game hacking, it is not my purpose to build an aimbot but for learning how to use yolov5\
1.first of all you need to install conda\
2.second you just install all the packages that are listed in the requirements.txt file\
3.if your pc dont support cuda you may need to change the device to cpu instead of GPU\
4.run the `main` python file 

# Things to fix
1.find the offset or convert the 2d coordinates to 3d coordinates for better aiming which mean current aiming is not good it sucks\
2.should choose the enemy which close enough to your alignment
